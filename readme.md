### Download

### Description

Secure Passkeys is a powerful WordPress plugin that enables seamless passwordless authentication using WebAuthn technology. By eliminating the need for traditional passwords, it enhances security and improves the user login experience. With support for biometric authentication, security keys, and device-bound credentials, Secure Passkey provides a robust and user-friendly solution for modern authentication.

Unlike traditional password-based authentication, Secure Passkey leverages cryptographic key pairs to ensure secure logins. The private key remains securely stored on the userâ€™s device, while the public key is registered with the WordPress site. This method protects against phishing attacks and password breaches, ensuring that only authorized users can gain access.

Secure Passkeys integrates effortlessly into WordPress, allowing users to register and manage their passkeys from their profile settings. Once registered, users can log in using their fingerprint, face recognition, or a hardware security key without the need to remember or enter a password.
